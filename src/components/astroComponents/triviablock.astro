        <p class="text-justify mt-4">
            Since her debut onto the country music scene in the late â€˜00s, Swift has had her share of celebrity boyfriends, perhaps none more celebrated than pop star and ex-One Direction member Harry Styles. 
In reality, the pair only dated from December 2012 to January 2013 (just one month), but the relationship left an impact, so do you think these songs are about Harry Styles?
